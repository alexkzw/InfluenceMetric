\title{Calculate Hadi's Influence Measure}
\usage{
calculate_hadis_influence(X, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix representing the design matrix (including the intercept term).}

\item{y}{A numeric vector representing the response variable.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector containing Hadi's Influence Measure for each observation.
}
\description{
This function calculates Hadi's Influence Measure for each observation in the
dataset, which is a measure of the influence of each observation on the
fitted regression model.
}
\examples{
set.seed(123)
n <- 10  # number of observations
p <- 2   # number of predictors (excluding intercept)

# Generate random data
X <- matrix(rnorm(n * p), n, p)
y <- rnorm(n)

# Add intercept term to the design matrix
X <- cbind(1, X)

# Calculate Hadi's Influence Measure
hadis_influence <- calculate_hadis_influence(X, y)

# Print Hadi's Influence Measure
print(hadis_influence)
}
