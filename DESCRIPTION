Description: This package provides functions to calculate and visualise various 
    influence measures for regression models. The package allows users to create
    a graph similar to Cook's distance plot but includes additional distance
    measures. Users can input a dataset and a model (an object of class 'lm') 
    to perform diagnostics on the influence of points. The package includes 
    implementations for Cook's Distance Measure (Cook, 1977), DFFITS (Welsch 
    and Kuh, 1977; Belsley, 1980), and Hadi's Influence Measure (Hadi, 1992).
